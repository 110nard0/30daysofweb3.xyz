You've made it! Now that you have your app up and running, use what you've learned to make this dapp your own. Design and build new features, update your UI, and add your personal touch. The next section will include content on Lens Protocol, our newest sponsor, and the tutorial will be up by mid-August. In the meantime, we encourage you to spend the next 3-7 days working on personalizing your dapp.

Some ideas for new features:

- Come up with a different way to get a unique eventID hash for each event
- Add another piece of information about the event that you want to store on-chain and update your smart contract and app to handle this additional data
- Create a dark theme for your UI and let users toggle between light and dark mode
- Allow users to pick from a gallery of images or upload their own image when creating events
- Add search functionality to enable users to find events by title, description, etc.
- Improve overall user experience around creating events and RSVP-ing to events by showing loading states and/or writing user-friendly error messages

There is no quiz for this section. Once you've worked on personalizing your dapp, head over to the final section **Wrapping Up**!

**End of Day 16**
