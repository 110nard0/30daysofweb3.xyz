## Define Events

Recall that Solidity events are a way for our subgraph to _listen_ for specific actions to enable us to make queries about the data from our smart contract. We have functions written to create a new event on our platform, RSVP to an event, confirm individual attendees, confirm the group of attendees, and send unclaimed funds back to the event owner. In order for our subgraph to be able to access the information from these functions, we need to expose them via events. We'll write the following events and _emit_ them inside of their corresponding function:

- **NewEventCreated**: exposes data about the new event like the owner, max capacity, event owner, deposit amount, etc.
- **NewRSVP**: exposes data about the user who RSVP'd and the event they RSVP'd to
- **ConfirmedAttendee**: exposes data about the user who was confirmed and the event that they were confirmed for
- **DepositsPaid**: exposes data about unclaimed deposits being sent to the event organizer

All of our events are denoted by using the keyword _event_, followed by the custom name for our event.

Define your events at the very top of your file, inside the curly braces (right after `contract Web3RSVP {`):

```solidity
event NewEventCreated(
    bytes32 eventID,
    address creatorAddress,
    uint256 eventTimestamp,
    uint256 maxCapacity,
    uint256 deposit,
    string eventDataCID
);

event NewRSVP(bytes32 eventID, address attendeeAddress);

event ConfirmedAttendee(bytes32 eventID, address attendeeAddress);

event DepositsPaidOut(bytes32 eventID);
```

## Emit Events

Now that we've defined them, we actually have to _emit_ them somewhere. Defining events is adding them as a tool on your toolbelt, but emitting them is actually pulling that tool out and using it. Each event should be emitted where it makes sense, after a specific action has been taken.

For our first event, `newEventCreated`, we should emit this at the very end of our function `createNewEvent`.

To emit an event, we use the keyword _emit_ and then pass in the arguments, AKA the actual values we want, based on the parameters we defined.

Emit NewEventCreated at the bottom of your `createNewEvent` function like this:

```solidity
emit NewEventCreated(
    eventId,
    msg.sender,
    eventTimestamp,
    maxCapacity,
    deposit,
    eventDataCID
);
```

`NewRSVP` should be emitted at the very end of our function `createNewRSVP` like this:

```solidity
emit NewRSVP(eventId, msg.sender);

```

`ConfirmedAttendees` should be emitted at the very end of our function `confirmAttendee` like this:

```solidity
emit ConfirmedAttendee(eventId, attendee);

```

`DepositPaidOut` should be emitted at the very end of our function `withdrawUnclaimedDeposits` like this:

```solidity
emit DepositsPaidOut(eventId);

```

## You Did It!

You've written your functions, defined your structs, and defined custom events! This is what your final code should look like:

```solidity
