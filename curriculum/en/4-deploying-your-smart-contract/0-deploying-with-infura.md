## What is Infura?

[**Infura**](https://infura.io/) is a company that provides web3 infrastructure tools that allow developers to develop on a blockchain. Infura provides the nodes that are the entry point to the blockchain and allow you to execute transactions. Without a node provider like Infura, a developer would have to run their own node to communicate with the blockchain, which can be expensive, difficult, and time consuming.

## How Infura fits into your project

Once we deploy our smart contract, we need it to be able to communicate with the blockchain to execute transactions (create a new event, rsvp to an existing event, etc). Because we donâ€™t want to run our own node, weâ€™ll use Infuraâ€™s node infrastructure to give us the functionality of interacting with the blockchain.

## Update hardhat config & install dotenv

We also need to update our `hardhat.config.js` file with information about what network we will deploy to, a provider URL from Infura, and our walletâ€™s private key. Because this includes sensitive information ( Reminder: _NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE!_ ), we will store our provider URL and private key in a new .env file in the root directory of our folder.

At the root of your project, create a file called ".env". Alternatively, you can also run `touch .env` in your terminal and it will create the .env file for you.

Then, install `dotenv` by running `npm install dotenv`. Dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file - it will allow you to keep your private keys secure while using them in your app and will keep you from committing these to github.

Update your `hardhat.config.js` file like this:

```javascript
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle"); //new update from hardhat requires to import 'hardhat-toolbox'
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337,
    },
    mumbai: {
      url: process.env.STAGING_INFURA_URL,
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.STAGING_PRIVATE_KEY}`],
      gas: 2100000,
      gasPrice: 8000000000,
    },
  },
};
```

## Configure Infura with Polygon Mumbai

Navigate to https://infura.io/ and create an account.
Go to â€˜Dashboardâ€™ and then hit â€˜Create new projectâ€™. Select â€˜Ethereumâ€™ from the dropdown selection and name your project.

Under the section, â€˜Keysâ€™, click the dropdown to change the endpoint to Polygon Mumbai.
If this is grayed out, youâ€™ll have to select it as an add-on. Infura may ask for a credit card to protect the service from being spammed by bots, but will not charge you (make sure the total amount shows $0).

Copy the new endpoint that appears in Infura after selecting Polygon Mumbai and save that as a variable to your project in the .env file we just created.

Next, get the private key from your Coinbase wallet by opening the extension and going to _Settings > Advanced Settings > Show private key_. Log in using your password and then copy your private key.

Head back to your .env file and create a variable called `STAGING_PRIVATE_KEY` and set the value to be your private key that you just copied. Here is what your `.env` file should look like now

```
STAGING_INFURA_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/12345678
STAGING_PRIVATE_KEY=1234_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_5678
```
