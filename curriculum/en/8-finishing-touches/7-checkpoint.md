You've made it! Now that you have your app up and running, use what you've learned to make this dapp your own. Add new features, update the UI, and add your own personal touches. The next section will be on Lens protocol, and this content will be up by mid August. In the meantime, we really encourage you to spend the next 3-7 days working on personalizing your dapp. Some ideas for new features:
- Add a dark mode toggle
- Come up with a different way to get a unique eventID hash for each event
- Add another piece of information about the event that you want to store on-chain and update your smart contract to handle this
- Update the UI so people get to pick from a list of images to display for their event


There is no quiz for this section. Once you've worked on personalizing your dapp, head over to the final section **Wrapping Up**!

**End of Day 16**
